A capsule shaped object, unlike a sphere, can bounce higher than its initial height when it is imparted with an initial spin. In this project, the dynamics of a bouncing rigid capsule was investigated. A novel set-up was constructed to vary the drop height and initial angular velocity, while keeping the initial translational velocity to be 0. Video data of dropping capsule was collected using a high-speed camera with 960 fps. The translational and angular velocity of the capsule was tracked with Python OpenCV using the k-nearest algorithm. Concepts of spring-mass-damper system, and Hertzian contact were used to fully model the bouncing dynamics of the capsule, shown from the agreement between our experiments and results.
